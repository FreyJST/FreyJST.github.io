					<h1>Analogue creature in a digital world</h1>I created this site in 2016, around the same time I came to understand the implications of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. I was horrified that the websites that had helped me develop social skills and cultivate a social life offline had been harvesting data about me like the robots in the fucking Matrix. This site was the beginning of me re-discovering my love for the internet, social media (in my view the whole internet is media that is social because that is the fucking point), and technology. I had always been interested in hand coded HTML sites made in Notepad and the like, but it wasn't until I discovered Neocities that I found a place to actually play with them, as well as meet others who were interested in them as well.<br>
					<br>
					I have a bad habit of changing my site name and fucking up everyone's links whenever I have another aesthetic identity crisis. The last two years or so I haven't had as much motivation or energy to keep overhauling my website on a spur of the moment, so it's given me time to actually think about what I want it to look like, and what I want it to do. I like so many different things it's hard to get them to work together sometimes.<br>
