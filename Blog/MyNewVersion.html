     <p>Welcome Back Everone i'm Frey some random guy who is not a blogger but just a programmer 
         for fun. <br />
         ok as now my introduction is finished let's move to the real thing which is what the heck is 
         my new version and what i'm talking about ? Well as you can see i'm nothing just nothing but 
         being nothing is not so good until you have some rich ass family or your dad is in some good higher 
         position well good for me i don't have any of this so what i am left with is on reling on my own
         brain and body in short i'm the only one who is going to do everything from scratch.<br />
         so i have decided to change my life from now on and will become a new person (not like i am going to 
         have a fake id or like that it's just i am going to learn some skills) well i think the best way to become 
         better is to learbn some skills and keeping this in mind i am going to learn some new skills and this will bring up
         some ideas for my youtube channel because more new things i will lean the more i will able to teach.

         <br /> 
         <strong> story </strong>
         <br />
         Today i was talking with my mom and she have some hopes left in me that i'm going to so something although i think i am 
         just some worthless being and that's the on;y reason i'm so much motivated to change myself and end up in my new version 
         so let me list out what are the things i am going to learn and let's do them everyday for 1 Month what youy say ?
         and if you like you can also follow along with me and share your views.
        <br />
         <li> Learning 5 New English Words Per Day</li>
         The reason on doing this is simple i am just going to build up my vocabulary beacuse i know it's not that good as it looks 
         and i'm sick of searching out of synonyms of the words. 
         <li> My Cyber Security Career </li>
         well as i have promissed that my channel FreyJST is going to upload 200+ videos regarding cyber security 
         so i thing i have to start with the world and keep my head up to the track that what is going on in the cyber world for this 
         i am all depended on Hacker News welll you can also find them easily on telegram they have there offical channel in there.
         and for doing this i am also building my life in the same fiels i love and always wanted to end up there although i love to start my own company 
         but for that again i need lot's of experence first.
         <li>Learning Japanese</li>
         well the reason is simple as fuck as being a weeb i want to watch anime without sub oneday, don't get any wrong ideas i don't want to date any Japanese girl as 
         per my current condition i can't even think of that.
         <li>Reading Bhagavad Gita Everday</li>
         well this is very important for keeping my dirty mind in check 
         <br/> so i will do this and it will only takes around 4 to 5 min in reading one slok 
         <li>My Indian Education (My syllabus)</li> 
         ok i will promiss to myself that i will go through each subject everyday 
         <li>Gym !</li>
         well i think i am giving to much of load to my brain so why not shifting some of that to body too lol
         for going to gym i don't need anyone i will go there alone and do some regular exercise.
