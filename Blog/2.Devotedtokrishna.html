हरे कृष्ण हरे कृष्ण कृष्ण कृष्ण हरे हरे हरे राम हरे राम राम राम हरे हरे॥

I'm nothing in front of mighty God, I'm just matter who does not matter without him, i don't actually believe in any god or religion but whenever these mantra goes around my inner soul just go with the flow and accept the bright side automatically like at that time there is nothing darkness left in my heart all what left behind is calmness and peace

I want to learn more about Krishna
Who is he
From where is come from and how he's so mighty that a person like me also want to walk on his footsteps

If you are watching me right now Krishna please don't help me just keep watching over me and i swear to you that I will end up in a place where i can also lead humans and create same place you have dreams actually you haven't (i know) but i think there are still hope left for human kind and surely they all can change and follow the path of peace and morals just what they want is someone who can guide i know i got my dark devil's living inside me in form of anger and sometimes i wish or work so all human kind will end and i will laugh like a mad men on them but now I'm awaken
I'm awaken Krishna
I'm awaken
I'm great full to you Krishna for giving me such brain and body i can improve these 2 things more but my soul belongs to you and you only and if it is possible please let me meet you one day personally and i have also heard that you visits earth time to time so if i end up with you someday please just smile on me or give me some hint in any form
